MCP Server running on http://localhost:8000 — 34 tools registered
/health endpoint returns OK
/chat endpoint receives questions, correctly calls OpenAI (returns 401 because key is placeholder)


Data flow:
User (chat.php) → chat.js → chat_api.php → MCP Server (/chat)
    → OpenAI gpt-4o-mini (with 34 tools defined)
    → LLM decides which tools to call
    → MCP executes tools → calls PHP api.php endpoints
    → Results fed back to LLM → final answer → user

Edit mcp_server/.env and replace with OPENAI_API_KEY
